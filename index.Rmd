Hi! I’m EV, a second-year Bachelor of Business Administration student with a growing focus on data analysis, marketing research, and business strategy. I enjoy turning messy data into clear insights and building clean, professional reports using R Markdown, Excel, and GitHub.

This portfolio showcases a selection of my academic work, including business analytics, marketing research, and operational analysis projects. You’ll find examples of R Markdown reporting, Excel-based analytics, and structured recommendations grounded in real data.
