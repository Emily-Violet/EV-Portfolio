I’m a Business Administration student at Vancouver Island University with experience in data analysis, marketing research, and business problem-solving. My academic work focuses on using analytical tools to understand trends, support decisions, and communicate insights clearly.

## Education

- Bachelor of Business Administration (in progress), Vancouver Island University  
- Coursework includes: Marketing Research, E-Management, Statistics, Finance, Microeconomics, Macroeconomics, and Data Reporting with R Markdown

## Technical Skills

- **Data Analysis:** Excel (pivot tables, statistics, cleaning), R & R Markdown  
- **Reporting:** GitHub Pages, HTML reporting, professional visualizations  
- **Business Tools:** Survey design, descriptive analysis, hypothesis testing  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub (site deployment, workflow automation)



## Outside of Business

When I’m not studying or working on analytics projects, you can usually find me outside - mountain biking, running, or exploring new trails. I love the outdoors, adventure, and the mix of focus + creativity that comes from balancing academics with active time outside.
